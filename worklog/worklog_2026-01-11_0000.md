# Worklog: Unit tests coverage for MyMoney

## Outcome
We want to achieve: Full JUnit coverage (no Mockito) for all main classes, ensuring behavior is validated per CLI commands and service flows.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Failing tests created for every class under `src/main/java/com/example/geektrust/**`.
- [ ] Tests cover happy paths and error paths for parsing, dispatch, domain, and service behaviors.
- [ ] `mvn test` passes with added tests.

## Component TODOs

### Tests
- [ ] Add JUnit tests for `Main` to assert usage message and runner invocation.
- [ ] Add JUnit tests for `app` package (`ApplicationBootstrap`, `AppRunner`, `MyMoneyAppService`).
- [ ] Add JUnit tests for `cli` package (`CommandType`, `LineParser`, `ParsedInput`).
- [ ] Add JUnit tests for `dispatch` package (`CommandHandlers`, `Dispatcher`, `InputUtil`).
- [ ] Add JUnit tests for `domain` package (`FundType`, `Month`, `Portfolio`, `PortfolioSnapshot`).
- [ ] Add JUnit tests for `service` package (`PortfolioService`).

### Tooling
- [ ] Run `mvn test` and ensure green.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All TODOs above are complete.
- [ ] Tests pass locally.
- [ ] Work explained with references to behaviors.
